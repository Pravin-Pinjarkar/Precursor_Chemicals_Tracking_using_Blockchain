# End-to-End Secure Tracking of Precursor Chemicals Using Blockchain with Anomaly Detection

## Project Overview
This project implements a secure and transparent system for tracking precursor chemicals across the supply chain using blockchain technology.  
It ensures data integrity, traceability, and real-time monitoring while detecting abnormal activities through anomaly detection techniques.

The goal is to prevent illegal diversion, misuse, and manipulation of sensitive chemical materials.

## Key Features
- Blockchain-based immutable transaction records
- End-to-end supply chain traceability
- Secure batch creation and tracking
- Role-based access (Manufacturer, Distributor, Laboratory, Regulator)
- Anomaly detection for suspicious activities
- Tamper-proof history of chemical movement

---

## Technologies Used
- Blockchain (Smart Contracts)
- Python / Django (Backend)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Frontend)
- Database (SQLite / MongoDB)
- Anomaly Detection Algorithms
- Cryptographic Hashing

---

## My Project Roles
- Chemical Manufacturer
- Distributor
- Lab Assistant


---

## Workflow
1. Chemical batches are created by manufacturers  
2. Each transaction is stored on blockchain  
3. Batches move across supply chain securely  
4. Anomaly detection monitors unusual behavior  
5. Authorities verify complete history

## Security Benefits
- Data cannot be altered once stored  
- Full transparency & auditability  
- Prevents fraud and illegal chemical usage
